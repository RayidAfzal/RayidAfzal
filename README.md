## 🚀 About Me

I'm an engineering student on a mission to bridge creativity with technology.  
From AR games to wearable tech for care homes, I'm always building projects that *do something real*.

💡 Interests:
- 🛠️ Embedded systems, AR/VR, IoT  
- 🎮 Game mechanics, interaction design  
- 💻 CTFs, digital systems, system architecture  
- 📷 Photography, music, and the occasional cat meme 🐱

> Visual cue-based identification system – accessible, reliable, human-centered

🎛️ **FPGA-Based Obstacle Navigation Game**  
> Whiteboard to screen with real-time control using Spartan-6 FPGA – yes, it's as cool as it sounds
